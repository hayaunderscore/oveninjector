# Startup Mods

**Not implemented yet!**

Do you want a mod to be enabled immediately after launching the game instead of waiting until you get into the mod menu?
Simply put a `startup.txt` file in your mods folder like so:

```plaintext,filepath=mods/startup.txt
Lap 3
Some Other Mod
Another Mod
```

This will load Lap 3, Some Other Mod, and Another Mod in that order.
This is based on the folder name of the mod however!

You can add to this file easily by pressing the shoot key while selecting a mod in the mod menu.
