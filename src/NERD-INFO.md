# Introduction

**OvenInjector** is a modloader for Pizza Tower! Inspired by ToppinLoader, this loads mods in a modular way for users to easily use and for modders to easily make. As this is currently a work in progress not everything is complete, and major changes may come between updates.

- Load multiple mods
- Easy to use mod menu
- A (hopefully simple) Modding API
- Powered by GameMaker Language (GML) ~~Lua soon?~~

This guide is an introduction on what the mod loader does, how to use it, and how to make mods for it.
