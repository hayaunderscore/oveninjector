# Usage

So you just downloaded OvenInjector. Great! Now where are the mods, you may ask? Well, you make them. Mods don't grow on trees, especially with a mod loader this new!

OvenInjector already comes with 3 mods by default for you to play around with!
- Breakplant
  - This mod brings back the Breakdance and Faceplant moves seen in earlier Pizza Tower builds
- Lap 3
  - A full port of Warioplier's Lap 3 mod! Enjoy getting that joocy p rank while running from pita face
- Pizza Multi
  - "Destroy one, another one will take it's place."
  
Open up your options menu in-game or in the title screen, and select "MOD MENU". Congratition!

You should now be able to enable and disable mods, as well as their configuration via the taunt key if they have one.
~~You can also press the shoot key (configurable in the bindings menu) to make a mod automatically be loaded after launching the game.~~ Not implemented yet. ;)
